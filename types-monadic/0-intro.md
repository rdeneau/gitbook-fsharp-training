# Intro

F♯ does not use category theory terminology: there are no explicit mentions of _Monad_.

However, F♯ provides 2 monadic types, `Option` and `Result`, and a powerful feature called _Computation Expressions_ that is designed to bring category theory into F♯ in an on-demand and behind-the-scenes manner.

# Monadic Types

F♯ does not use category theory terminology: there are no explicit mentions of *Monad*. However, F♯ provides 2 monadic types, `Option` and `Result`, and a powerful feature called *Computation Expressions* that is designed to bring category theory into F♯ in a more hidden and on-demand manner.

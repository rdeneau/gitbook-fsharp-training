## Types Composition

### Creating new types

Algebraic data types do not support ~~inheritance~~

* They cannot inherit from a base class.
* They are `sealed`: they cannot be inherited.
* But they can implement interfaces.

Algebraic types are created by composition:

* Aggregation into a _product type_ (_Record_, _Tuple_)
* "Choice" in a _sum type_ (_Union_)

### Combine 2 unions?

Consider the 2 unions below dealing with French-suited cards (‚ô† ‚ô£ ‚ô• ‚ô¶):

```fsharp
type Black = Pike | Club
type Red = Heart | Tile
```

How do you combine them to create a union of `Pike`, `Club`, `Heart` or `Tile`?

#### By flattening unions, as in TypeScript ‚ùå

```fsharp
type Color = Black | Red
```

‚Üí It's not the expected result: `Color` is an enum-style union, with 2 cases `Black` and `Red`, totally disconnected from the `Black` and `Red` types!

#### By creating a brand new union ‚ö†Ô∏è

```fsharp
type Color = Pike | Club | Hear | Tile
let pike = Pike
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Warnings

* Can create confusion: `Pike` refers to `Color.Pike` or `Black.Pike`?
* Need to write mappers between the 2 models: `(Black, Red) <-> Color`
{% endhint %}

#### By composition ‚úÖ

```fsharp
type Color = Black of Black | Red of Red
let pike = Black Pike
```

‚Üí  The new union `Color` is composed based on the 2 previous types:

* `Black` union is used as data for the `Color.Black` case
* `Red` union is used as data for the `Color.Red` case

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Note

It's common in F‚ôØ to write union cases like `Black of Black` where the case name matches the case field type.
{% endhint %}

## Conclusion

Lots of ways to model!

üí° Opportunity for:

* Team discussions
* Business domain encoding in types

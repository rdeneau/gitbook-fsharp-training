# ðŸ“œ Wrap up

That's a lot just about functions ðŸ˜‰ But they are corner stone.

* Signature with arrow notation `->`
* Universal signature `T -> U` thanks to `unit`type and currying
* Generic function, anonymous function, lambda
* Recursive function and _tail recursion_
* Differences between functions and methods
* Standard functions and operators, including `|>`, `>>`, `<|`
* Overload or create operator
* Point-free style
* Interoperability with the BCL

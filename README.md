## Why F♯

In detail :

* Multi-paradigm language with a strong functional orientation
  * Functional programming _(FP)_ principles: immutability and composition
  * Building blocks: functions and algebraic data types _(ADT)_
* "Fun" ! Very pleasant to write and read
  * Expressive and concise (not very verbose syntax)
  * Sensitive to indentation → easy to read
  * Strong static typing but it's almost seamless thanks to type inference
* Language entreprise-friendly
  * Runs on the .NET platform → high performance, easy interop with C# projects, .NET ecosystem and libraries
  * Very good tooling: Visual Studio, VsCode, Rider
  * Robust code: predictable and reproducible results (immutability, structural equality, no nulls, exhaustive pattern matching)
  * Interactive programming: check code by evaluating it in the FSI console
  * Narrowed community but strong and friendly
* F# compared to other back-end functional languages
  * Its syntax is not hybrid, unlike **Scala** and **Kotlin** (mixing OOP and FP)
  * Easier to learn than **Haskell** or **OCaml** _(but with fewer FP features, partially compensated for by OOP features)_
  * Static typing, unlike **Closure** _(and far fewer brackets 😜)_

## Convention
